```asm

.model flat, stdcall
.stack 4096
ExitProcess PROTO, dwExitCode:DWORD

.data

.code

## 5.
After addition.
al = 4h
4h = 00000100
The number of 1 bits is not even.
The Parity flag will be set to zero.

## 6.
EAX will be -1 (FFFFFFFFh) so the Sign flag will be set to 1.

## 7.
al is signed meaning it won't be able to hold more than the result of add instruction which is 129, meaning the OV should be set to 1 but the visual studio compiler doesn't set that flag to 0 for some reason:
```asm
.386
.model flat, stdcall
.stack 4096
ExitProcess PROTO, dwExitCode:DWORD


.code 
main PROC
	mov al,-1
	add al,130

	nop
	invoke ExitProcess,0
main ENDP
END main
```

```asm
.386
.model flat, stdcall
.stack 4096
ExitProcess PROTO, dwExitCode:DWORD


.code 
main PROC
	mov al,-1
	add al,130
	JO overflow_detected

	nop
	invoke ExitProcess,0

overflow_detected:
	invoke ExitProcess,5

main ENDP
END main
```

Still it doesn't jump to overflow_detected, some compiler thing maybe idk
