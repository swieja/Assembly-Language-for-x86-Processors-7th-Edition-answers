; (Requires reading ahead to Section 11.1.11.) Create a macro that writes a null-terminated string to
; the console with a given text color. The macro parameters should include the string name and the
; color. Hint: Call SetTextColor from the bookâ€™s link library. Write a program that tests your macro
; with several strings in different colors. Sample call:

mWriteTestString MACRO stringToBePrinted, color
	push eax
	push edx

	mov eax, color
	call SetTextColor
	mov edx, offset stringToBePrinted
	call WriteString
	call Crlf

	pop edx
	pop eax
ENDM

myString BYTE "This is a test string",0

	mWriteTestString myString, blue
	mWriteTestString myString, red
	mWriteTestString myString, green
