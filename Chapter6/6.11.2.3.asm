;Create a procedure named CalcGrade that receives an integer value between 0 and 100, and
;returns a single capital letter in the AL register. Preserve all other register values between calls
;to the procedure. The letter returned by the procedure should be according to the following
;ranges:

;Write a test program that generates 10 random integers between 50 and 100, inclusive. Each
;time an integer is generated, pass it to the CalcGrade procedure. You can test your program
;using a debugger, or if you prefer to use the bookâ€™s library, you can display each integer and its
;corresponding letter grade. (The Irvine32 library is required for this solution program because it
;uses the RandomRange procedure.)
